Assignment #1 is an introductory assignment to make students familiar with Git and Python. Git allows us to collaborate in a team, while Python and installed libraries (pandas, numpy and matplotlib) facilitated data analysis and data vizualization. This assignment provided students with datasets with information regarding student grades in Math and English as well as their room numbers. Based on performed data analysis, we identified students with the highest GPAs in each class and tried to find correlation between subject performance. This data was presented in histograms and scatter plots for ease of interpretation.
